  <h4>Game creation</h4>

  <h5>Mode</h5>
  <p>The game mode:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>In <span class="text-primary">capture</span> games the players compete for the words, the first player that typed a
    word wins it. The round winner is the player who caught the most words before the round expires.</li>
  <li>In <span class="text-primary">race</span> games the same list of words is duplicated for each player. The round
    winner is the player who caught all his words the fastest, or the most words before the round expires.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Rounds</h5>
  <p>The number of winning rounds.</p>

  <h5>Language</h5>
  <p>The language of the generated words.</p>

  <h5>Words effect</h5>
  <p>An optional effect used to display the words:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="text-primary">None</span> effect actually uses no effect, the word is displayed as is, e.g.
      <button class="btn btn-primary">DANCER</button>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-primary">Hidden</span> effect hides one letter for words of up to 6 letters, two letters between 7
      and 10 letters, three letters otherwise, e.g.
      <button class="btn btn-primary">D_NCER</button>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-primary">Reverse</span> effect reverses the letters of the word, e.g.
      <button class="btn btn-primary">RECNAD</button>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="text-primary">Anagram</span> effect shuffles the letters, e.g.
      <button class="btn btn-primary">CRANDE</button>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h5>Words count</h5>
  <p>In race games, this is the number of words per round. In capture games, the number of words per round is that
    number multiplied by the number of players.</p>

  <h5>Words length</h5>
  <p>The words length presets:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="text-primary">Shortest</span> is 3 to 5 letters</li>
    <li><span class="text-primary">shorter</span> is 4 to 6 letters</li>
    <li><span class="text-primary">standard</span> is 5 to 8 letters</li>
    <li><span class="text-primary">longer</span> is 6 to 10 letters</li>
    <li><span class="text-primary">longest</span> is 7 to 12 letters</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Game play</h4>

  <p>When typing the words, the case does not matter, you can use write lowercase.</p>
  <p>Using the Space bar clears the input.</p>
  <p>Game rounds have an expiration, i.e. after a while the remaining words are not available anymore and the scores are accessible.</p>

  <h4>Scores</h4>

  <p>At the end of a round, the round scores and game scores are displayed.</p>
  <p>The round scores show the number of caught words and the type speed in words per minute.</p>
  <p>The game scores show the number of rounds won and the best type speed so far.</p>
  <p>The scores also show some awards:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="text-primary">First</span> for the player who caught the first word of the round</li>
    <li><span class="text-primary">Longest</span> for the player who first caught the longest word</li>
    <li><span class="text-primary">Double</span> for any player who caught two words in a row, only in capture
      mode
    </li>
    <li><span class="text-primary">Last</span> for the player who caught the last word of the round, only in
      capture mode
    </li>
  </ul>
